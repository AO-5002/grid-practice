# UI Practice

I've always been afraid of working with media queries and, in general, responsive design, so I decided to create a project to practice these skills. I recreated this Figma design using grid, flexbox, and media queries via Tailwind. I was pleasantly surprised to find out how easy it is to work with responsive design, and I'm glad I faced my deepest weakness in web development.
